Things to ask:
    Do we need the Tower subsystem to be closed loop or is open loop OK?

Write Climb subsystem
Write Shooter subsystem
Write Drivetrain subsystem
Write Intake subsystem

Functions:
    Move left -- Left Joystick left
    Move right -- Left Joystick right
    Move up -- Left Joystick up
    Move down -- Left Joystick down
    Turn left -- Right Joystick left
    Turn right -- Right Joystick right
    Intake down -- D-pad down
    Intake up -- D-pad up
    Intake run -- X
    Intake reverse -- Y
    Climb up -- Left Bumper
    Climb down -- Left Trigger
    Shooter up -- Right Bumper
    Shooter down -- Right Trigger
    Shooter run -- A
    Shooter reverse -- B

Things to do:
    Figure out the calculation for what angle I should shoot at based off of the angle of the apriltag
    Use getInstance methods in the RobotContainer.java file when instantiating the subsystems.

To do with Rookies:
    Have them implement the getInstance method for the shooter subsystem.
    Have them fix the references in SetShooterAngle.java
    Show them how ryan wants the states implemented.

Math Stuff: (all angles are in degrees)
PhotonVision gives me 6 things.
1. Target -- The visible targets in order of clarity.
2. Fiducial ID -- The ID of the apriltag.
3. X -- How far away the apriltag is on the x axis (meters)
4. Y -- How far away the apriltag is on the y axis (meters)
5. Z angle -- The difference in yaw of the apriltag and the camera (degrees) (0 means that you are facing the apriltag)
6. Ambiguity -- Unknown

```
// Creating the camera
PhotonCamera camera = new PhotonCamera(String cameraName);

// Getting the result from the camera
var result = camera.getLatestResult();

if (result.hasTargets()) {
  // Getting the targets the camera sees
  var targets = result.targets;

  // Getting the best result from the camera
  var bestTarget = result.getBestTarget();

  
  double yaw = bestTarget.getYaw();
  double pitch = bestTarget.getPitch();
  Pose2d camToTarget = bestTarget.getBestCameraToTarget();

}

```

if limelight is at 0 deg, then the tY is the angle of the limelight to the apriltag.
Figure out the side lengths based off of the angles.

  c
  |\
  | \
  |  \
A |   \ B
  |    \
  |     \
  |______\
 b    C   a

A/sin(a) = B/sin(b) = C/sin(c)

I get the "a" angle from the limelight if the pitch is 0
I get the length of side "A" from the given values of how high off the ground the apriltag is.
Angle "b" is always 90
Angle "c" is then 90-"a"
Side "B" = A * sin(b) / sin(a)
Side "C" = A * sin(c) / sin(a)

Side "B" is the distance the note needs to travel.
Side "C" is the lateral distance from the robot to the speaker
Limelight may be at 45 deg pitch, so "a" will be tY + 45
Note: Change the location of point a to be in the center of the robot.
That way, I am calculating the angle for the robot, not the camera.
Shooter is 10 inches off the ground.

We are using photonvision
